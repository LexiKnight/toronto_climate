abstract: "This datasheet presents the results of a study examining the relationship between age and education and individuals' likelihood to adopt climate-friendly behaviors. The data reveals patterns showing that younger people and those with higher levels of education are more inclined to engage in actions like reducing car usage and conserving energy. In contrast, older individuals are more likely to focus on long-term sustainability efforts such as energy efficiency. Financial barriers and skepticism about individual impact remain significant obstacles to broader climate action. The findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to make sustainable behaviors more accessible across demographic groups."

Extract of the questions from @gebru2021datasheets.

# Motivation

1. **For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.**
    - The dataset was created to explore how demographic factors such as age and education level influence the likelihood of individuals adopting climate-friendly behaviors. The data fills a gap in understanding the relationship between socio-demographic variables and sustainable behavior adoption.

2. **Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?**
    - Created by OpenDataToronto, under the research project on climate change perspectives, in collaboration with environmental studies groups and local climate organizations.

3. **Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.**
    - Funded by personal resources and a minor grant from the City of Toronto's environmental studies program.

4. **Any other comments?**
    - The dataset is part of a broader effort to collect and analyze public opinions on climate change and sustainability in Toronto.

# Composition

1. **What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.**
    - Each instance in the dataset represents an individual participant in the survey. The dataset includes demographic information and responses to questions about climate-related behaviors.

2. **How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?**
    - The 2018 dataset contains 404 instances whereas the 2021 dataset contains 1400 instances, each corresponding to a single participant’s responses.

3. **Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).**
    - The dataset is a sample of Toronto residents aged 18-65. The sample is intended to be representative of the general population in terms of age, education level, and climate-related behavior, though certain demographic groups (e.g., low-income residents) are slightly underrepresented due to survey limitations.

4. **What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.**
    - Each instance consists of processed survey data, including categorical features (age group, education level, etc.) and numeric responses (e.g., likelihood of adopting behaviors, number of sustainable actions taken).

5. **Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.**
    - The target variable is the "likelihood of adopting climate-friendly behaviors," which is a scale ranging from 1 to 5 (1 being least likely, 5 being most likely).

6. **Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.**
    - There is some missing data for specific questions related to education, as some respondents chose not to provide this information.

7. **Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.**
    - There are no explicit relationships between individual instances; the data is cross-sectional and independent.

8. **Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.**
    - It not known based on the dataset itsef howevery we split the data into 80% training and 20% testing for machine learning tasks (to generate the models).

9. **Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.**
    - There are minor errors in the self-reported data, such as inconsistent responses. There is also instances where individuals did not respond such as stating their education level.

10. **Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.**
    - The dataset is self-contained and does not rely on external resources.

11. **Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.**
    - The dataset does not contain any confidential information, though demographic data could be considered personal.

12. **Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.**
    - No, the dataset does not contain offensive or harmful data.

13. **Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these sub-populations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.**
    - Yes, the dataset identifies sub-populations by age and education level. Age is split into 18-35, 36-50, 51-65 and 65+. Education levels range from high school to postgraduate education however the specific categories vary between the 2018 and 2021 survey. 

14. **Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.**
    - No, the dataset is anonymized and does not allow for the identification of individual persons.

15. **Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.**
    - The dataset contains demographic information, including education level, which may be sensitive, but no other sensitive data such as race, health, or financial status.

16. **Any other comments?**
    - The dataset is intended to support climate behavior research and advocacy efforts to improve public sustainability initiatives.
