abstract: "This paper explores the factors limiting individuals from adopting environmentally friendly behaviors, drawing on survey data to understand motivations and barriers. Findings reveal that while many people are aware of climate change, obstacles like cost, convenience, and perceived effectiveness hinder sustainable actions. Additionally, the research highlights which methods of communication are most effective across different age groups. By addressing these barriers and tailoring strategies for engagement, cities can better empower residents to contribute to meaningful climate action, fostering a more sustainable urban future."

# Introduction

Climate change remains one of the most pressing global challenges, with rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and environmental degradation threatening ecosystems and human well-being. Despite the urgent need for individual and collective action, many people continue to struggle with adopting sustainable behaviors in daily life. Governments and communities are increasingly interested in understanding how to motivate environmentally friendly practices, but significant gaps remain in identifying and addressing the obstacles that prevent action. This paper seeks to bridge that gap by examining not only what prevents individuals from engaging in sustainable behaviors but also what communication strategies can effectively inspire change.

This study focuses on a survey conducted in 2018, which gathered insights into people’s awareness of climate change, their likelihood of taking specific climate-friendly actions, the reasons behind inaction, preferred ways of receiving climate-related information, and demographic characteristics such as age and education. We investigate the extent to which people feel informed about climate change, their readiness to adopt energy-efficient practices, reduce waste, and embrace greener transportation options, among other behaviors. Our analysis also sheds light on the barriers individuals face, ranging from financial and logistical concerns to doubts about the impact of their actions, and explores how demographic factors influence communication preferences.

Addressing the gap between climate awareness and action is critical for effective community climate initiatives. Studies show that while awareness of environmental issues is widespread, behavioral change remains limited (Gifford, 2011). Additionally, research indicates that communication strategies tailored to specific demographics can enhance engagement and effectiveness (Moser & Dilling, 2007). Yet, there is little empirical evidence that explores how personalized communication and targeted interventions can overcome barriers to sustainable behaviors. Our study aims to fill this gap by estimating the causal impact of various factors on individuals’ willingness and ability to engage in environmentally friendly practices and identifying the best strategies for promoting sustainable change.

We found that practical obstacles, such as cost and convenience, alongside perceptions of ineffectiveness, are the primary reasons for inaction. Moreover, age and education level significantly shape how people prefer to receive information about climate action, suggesting that a one-size-fits-all communication strategy may be insufficient. These findings have substantial implications for policymakers and community leaders seeking to design more impactful climate initiatives. By addressing key barriers and tailoring engagement strategies, cities can empower individuals to adopt sustainable behaviors, making meaningful progress toward climate resilience and environmental sustainability.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: @sec-data presents the methods used to analyze these demographic differences, followed by @sec-results, which details the results of the comparison between Rosedale-Moore Park and Downtown Yonge East. @sec-discussion offers a discussion of the findings, highlighting the implications for understanding residential segregation in Toronto. Finally, @sec-conclusion concludes with a reflection on the limitations of the study and suggestions for future research directions.

# Model {#sec-model}
The goal of our modelling strategy is twofold. Firstly,...
Here we briefly describe the Bayesian analysis model used to investigate... Background details and diagnostics are included in [Appendix -@sec-appendix].
## Model set-up
Define $y_i$ as the number of seconds that the plane remained aloft. Then $\beta_i$ is the wing width and $\gamma_i$ is the wing length, both measured in millimeters.  

\begin{align} 
y_i|\mu_i, \sigma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i &= \alpha + \beta_i + \gamma_i\\
\alpha &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\gamma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\sigma &\sim \mbox{Exponential}(1)
\end{align}

We run the model in R [@citeR] using the `rstanarm` package of @rstanarm. We use the default priors from `rstanarm`.

### Model Specifications ###
### Model Justification 
We expect a positive relationship between the size of the wings and time spent aloft. In particular...

We can use maths by including latex between dollar signs, for instance $\theta$.
